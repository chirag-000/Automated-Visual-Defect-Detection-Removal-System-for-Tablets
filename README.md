# Automated-Visual-Defect-Detection-Removal-System-for-Tablets
The project is a system that i have built which detects any visual defect in a tablet moving on the conveyor belt in Real-Time and removes only the defected ones. I have Integrated a custom YOLOv8 model for real-time defect detection with an STM32 microcontroller to control the servo motor that removes defective tablets right away from the conveyor belt. And established serial communication between wxWidgets application and the STM32 to enable real-time defect logging and management.

# Automated-Visual-Defect-Detection-Removal-System-for-Tablets
I developed a real-time tablet defect detection and removal system that integrates a custom YOLOv8 model for visual inspection. The system is designed to detect any defects in tablets moving along a conveyor belt and immediately remove the defective ones using a servo motor controlled by an STM32 microcontroller. Additionally, I established serial communication between the STM32 and a wxWidgets application, allowing for real-time defect logging and management.
